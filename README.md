# Cisco Packet Tracer - Basic ACL Firewall

A simple yet effective **router-based firewall** project using **Standard and Extended Access Control Lists (ACLs)** in Cisco Packet Tracer.

This project demonstrates how a Cisco router can act as a basic firewall to control traffic between an "Outside" (Internet) network and an "Inside" (LAN) network.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand how ACLs work as a basic firewall
- Configure **Standard ACL** (source IP filtering)
- Configure **Extended ACL** (source, destination, protocol & port filtering)
- Learn ACL placement rules (inbound vs outbound)
- Understand the **implicit deny all** rule
- Test allowed and blocked traffic

## 🛠 Topology

- **Devices**:
  - 1 × Cisco 2911 Router (acting as Firewall)
  - 2 × 2960 Switches
  - 3 × PCs (PC0 = Outside, PC1 & PC2 = Inside)

- **Networks**:
  - Outside Network: `192.168.10.0/24`
  - Inside Network:  `192.168.20.0/24`

## 📋 IP Addressing Table

| Device     | Interface/PC | IP Address          | Subnet Mask         | Default Gateway    |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Router     | G0/0 (Outside) | 192.168.10.1       | 255.255.255.0      | -                  |
| Router     | G0/1 (Inside)  | 192.168.20.1       | 255.255.255.0      | -                  |
| PC0        | NIC          | 192.168.10.10      | 255.255.255.0      | 192.168.10.1       |
| PC1        | NIC          | 192.168.20.10      | 255.255.255.0      | 192.168.20.1       |
| PC2        | NIC          | 192.168.20.20      | 255.255.255.0      | 192.168.20.1       |

## 🔧 Configuration Highlights

### 1. Standard ACL (Source IP Filtering)
```bash
access-list 10 permit host 192.168.20.10
access-list 10 deny any

interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip access-group 10 out
